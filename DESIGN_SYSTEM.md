The whole concept is built around a modular and adaptable system by making shapes move themselves to make the logo Cb for charles bruyerre and Sh for sharlee and a deconstructed version which includes both identities.

The main goals of this brand are to create fantasy out of reality by distorting it and to be unpredictable.


Each shapes layout contains the same shapes with a different position and/or a different 3D rotation. Some shapes can also be hidden behind other shapes.

The primary layout variants of shapes are used as logos. You can use the sh layout for mentionning the Sharlee identity, the cb layout for mentionning the Charles Bruyerre identity and finally, the deconstructed layout when no particular identity is mentionned. For more information about logo usage and clear space, you can go to the logotype section.


The horizontal layout is only used as a background texture or a wallpaper. Shapes are bigger and some parts are cut to look more abstract. The vertical layout is exclusively used for the website menu. More information here.


Appearance variants:

Shapes can have different appearances relates to the place where they’re used, or the background
